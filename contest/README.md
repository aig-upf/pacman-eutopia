# Pacman Capture the Flag Project Template

This repository is a template for students to fork their own repositories to carry out their own work for the [Pacman Capture the Flag](http://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html) project. We are very grateful to UC Berkeley CS188 for developing and sharing their system with us for teaching and learning purposes.

While the original code runs on Python 2.7, **this version runs on Python 3.x**. It also has a few bugs fixing.

You must ALWAYS keep your fork **private** and **never share it** with anybody in or outside the course, except your teammates, _even after the course is completed_. You are not allowed to make another repository copy outside the provided GitHub Classroom without the written permission of the teaching staff. Please respect the [authors request](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_instructions.html):

> **_Please do not distribute or post solutions to any of the projects._**

Remember to complete the [TEAM.md](TEAM.md) file with the team details of the submission.

Read [CONTEST.md](CONTEST.md) file for detailed information and documentation about the code of the contest.

Project should be developed as per instructions in the project specification.

Script `replay.py` provides a flexible way to re-run games stored under `replays/` folder.

**Hope you enjoy this project!**

### Academic Integrity

This is an advanced course, so we expect full professionalism and ethical conduct.  Plagiarism is a serious issue. **We trust you; please don't let us down**. The staff take academic misconduct very seriously. Suspected collusion or plagiarism will be dealt with according to the **University Academic Integrity policy**.

We expect every student taking this course to adhere to it **Code of Honour** under which every learner-student should:

* Submit their own original work.
* Do not share answers with others.
* Report suspected violations.
* Engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve their results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others.

Unethical behaviour is extremely serious and consequences are painful for everyone. We expect enrolled students/learners to take full **ownership** of your work and **respect** the work of teachers and other students.
